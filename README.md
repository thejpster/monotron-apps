# Monotron Applications

This repo contains example applications for [Monotron]. These applications can
be compiled as ARM Cortex-M4 binaries and loaded into the Monotron's RAM via
the serial port. They can also be compiled to run on a desktop Linux PC (for
testing).

You can write Monotron applications in either C or Rust. You'll find examples
of both here.
