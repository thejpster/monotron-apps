# Welcome to the Monotron

* This is the Monotron
* It can do ^rC^go^bl^co^mu^yr^d text

I am a Cortex-M4 powered home computer. My ROM
is written in the Rust Programming Language
(https://www.rust-lang.org).

I exist to show you can you take a modern
language and use it to write hard-real time
embedded systems. Plus retro computing is fun!

I drive an 800x600 VGA display through 3 SPI
peripherals at 20 MHz.

    ^yo^c 400x600 effective resolution
    ^yo^c 8 colours ^rR^gG^bB^cC^mM^yY
    ^yo^c 48 cols by 36 rows in text mode
    ^yo^c 8px by 16px characters
    ^yo^c CodePage 850 character set x03\x04\x05\x06
    ^yo^c Alternative 'Teletext' character set
    ^yo^c Support for custom fonts in RAM
